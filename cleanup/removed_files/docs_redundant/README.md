# Redundant Documentation - Archived

**Date Archived**: 2025-11-15
**Reason**: Consolidating documentation into simplified README.md

## Files Archived

- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Detailed implementation notes
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_OPTIONS.md` - Deployment and distribution options
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Project structure documentation
- `INSTALL.md` - Installation guide
- `GUI_START_GUIDE.md` - GUI usage guide

## Why Consolidated

- Reduced duplication across multiple files
- Single source of truth in README.md
- Easier for new users to find information
- Simplified maintenance

## Current Documentation

Main documentation is now in:
- `README.md` - Simplified, user-focused
- `README.detailed.md` - Comprehensive reference (moved from original README)

## Restoration

These archived docs are available for reference but are no longer actively maintained.
Key information has been consolidated into the main README.
